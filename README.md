This project uses Create React App + Redux and Redux Toolkit. The styles are built using tailwindcss.
The list of reminders persist from sessino to session using Redux-Persist.

In its current form, the deleted reminders persist in the redux store. That said, they are not currently used for anything.

Feel free to clone or use in your own project!
